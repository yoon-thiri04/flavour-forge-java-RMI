**Flavour Forge**👨🏻‍🍳 is our **Semester VII, CS-411 Distributed Computing System** project that helps users discover recipes effortlessly using only the ingredients they currently have. 

---

##  **🍳Overview** 

Flavour Forge allows users to search for recipes by entering the ingredients they already have. The system fetches real-world recipe🍛 data directly from the **Spoonacular API🥦**, 
displaying recipe suggestions with images, instructions, ingredients, and nutritional details.

Users can further refine their search using multiple filters such as 
- **Cuisine Type** - "Italian", "Chinese", "Indian", "Mexican", "American"
- **Recipe Category** - "Main Course", "Side Dish", "Dessert", "Snack", "Soup"
- **Diet Preferences** - "Vegetarian", "Vegan", "Gluten Free"
- **Sorting Options** - "Popularity", "Healthiness", "Calories"
- **Intolerances** - "Dairy", "Egg", "Gluten", "Peanut", "Seafood", etc..

The app also supports **Drink and Dessert** searches.

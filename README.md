# **Flavour Forge**

**Flavour Forge** is a Semester VII **CS-411 Distributed Computing System** project that helps users discover recipes effortlessly using only the ingredients they currently have. 

---

##  **Overview**

Flavour Forge allows users to search for recipes by entering the ingredients they already have. The system fetches real-world recipe data directly from the **Spoonacular API**, 
displaying recipe suggestions with images, instructions, ingredients, and nutritional details.

Users can further refine their search using multiple filters such as **cuisine type**, **recipe category**, **diet preferences**, **sorting options**, and **intolerances**. 
The app also supports **drink and dessert** searches.
